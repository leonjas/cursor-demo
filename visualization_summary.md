# SAT Score Visualizations Summary

This document summarizes the different visualization approaches for analyzing the student SAT score data beyond the original histogram visualization in `vis.py`.

## Original Visualization (vis.py)
- **Type**: Histogram with Normal Distribution Overlay
- **File**: `student_scores_visualization_20250718_225227.png`
- **Insights**: Shows the overall distribution shape, mean, median, and how well the data fits a normal distribution

## New Visualizations Generated

### 1. Box Plot Analysis
- **File**: `sat_scores_boxplot_20250719_030518.png`
- **Purpose**: Statistical summary visualization
- **Insights Provided**:
  - Quartiles (Q1, Q2/median, Q3)
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)
  - Outliers (scores unusually high or low)
  - Data spread and symmetry
  - Range of scores

### 2. Violin Plot
- **File**: `sat_scores_violin_20250719_030518.png`
- **Purpose**: Distribution density visualization
- **Insights Provided**:
  - Probability density at different score levels
  - Distribution shape (peaks, valleys, skewness)
  - Mean and median positions
  - More detailed view of distribution than histogram

### 3. Student Ranking Scatter Plot
- **File**: `sat_scores_ranking_20250719_030518.png`
- **Purpose**: Individual performance analysis
- **Insights Provided**:
  - Each student's rank from 1st to 100th
  - Color-coded scores for visual identification
  - Highlighted top 10 and bottom 10 performers
  - Performance percentile lines (90th and 10th percentiles)
  - Individual performance relative to peers

### 4. Score Categories Bar Chart
- **File**: `sat_scores_categories_20250719_030518.png`
- **Purpose**: Performance level distribution
- **Insights Provided**:
  - Number of students in each performance category:
    - Below Average (1000-1199)
    - Average (1200-1299)  
    - Above Average (1300-1399)
    - Excellent (1400-1499)
    - Outstanding (1500-1600)
  - Categorical distribution of class performance
  - Easy identification of performance tier concentrations

### 5. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)
- **File**: `sat_scores_cdf_20250719_030518.png`
- **Purpose**: Percentile and probability analysis
- **Insights Provided**:
  - What percentage of students scored below any given score
  - Percentile lines for key thresholds (10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th)
  - Cumulative probability distribution
  - Useful for understanding relative performance positions

### 6. Score Distribution Heatmap
- **File**: `sat_scores_heatmap_20250719_030518.png`
- **Purpose**: Concentration analysis
- **Insights Provided**:
  - Visual intensity showing where most students' scores cluster
  - Heat map representation of score frequency in 50-point ranges
  - Quick identification of score concentration areas
  - Alternative view of distribution peaks

## Comparative Analysis

### When to Use Each Visualization:

1. **Box Plot**: Best for identifying outliers and understanding quartile distributions
2. **Violin Plot**: Best for seeing the exact shape and density of the distribution
3. **Ranking Scatter Plot**: Best for identifying individual student performance and rankings
4. **Categories Bar Chart**: Best for understanding performance level distributions for academic planning
5. **CDF Plot**: Best for percentile analysis and understanding relative standings
6. **Heatmap**: Best for quickly spotting concentration patterns in score ranges

### Key Findings Across All Visualizations:
- SAT scores are relatively well distributed across the range
- Most students fall in the 1200-1400 range (Average to Above Average)
- The distribution appears roughly normal with slight variations
- No extreme outliers present in the data
- Good spread across performance categories

## Technical Notes
- All visualizations use consistent styling and color schemes
- High-resolution PNG files (300 DPI) suitable for reports or presentations
- Timestamps in filenames prevent overwriting previous versions
- Uses matplotlib and seaborn for professional-quality plots
